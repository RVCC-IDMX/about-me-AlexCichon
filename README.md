Also learned what coding was and how it works with everyline of code impacts the website. The skils I learned with implanmanting a nav bar that allows the user to go to different sections of my website with a click of a button. Learned how to implanment images into code to make them appear on the site, learned about different ways to implant text and different color styles to help people who suffer from seeing certain types of color. Learned how to change certain style of fonts/style throughout the code. Also taught me how to implant a video into the website giving it borders to stay within a certain amount of space provided. Learned about accessibility with people who might view the site on a non-computer device such as a phone or ipad and learned to make adjustments to the site for the people who are viewing them on a different device to be able to view it properly.
