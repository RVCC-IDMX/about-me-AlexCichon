            <article id="lit">
                <h2>Image Hover Effect</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>The image hover effects are effects that can be applied to an image and can be activated when
                        someone using a desktop, hovers the mouse over the image. Hover effects can be used for a range
                        of purposes and can also have a range of unique styles as well, these ranges include enlarging
                        the image, it also allows the adding of color or fading of the color of the image hover, and can
                        bring up an informative text overlay that is related to the image. When applying these hover
                        effects to your image make sure it is suitable for your image of the style and theme of the
                        website or company site you plan to implant the image on. If you are adding a hover effect for a
                        company, make sure that the effect is in a proper manner, and not fun and quirkiness but if the
                        company allows it, then it is alright to make it those hover effects. Image hover effects are
                        the most used CSS effects in web design. It can be done to any image or website, by simply
                        adding a couple of lines in your pageâ€™s language code. Hover effects bring interactivity and
                        motion to a design, they can make it more interactive by how they are more dynamic than other
                        websites.</p>
                    <p>There are many different hover effects such as zoom-on-hover effects, switching the states menu
                        to the hover state and adjusting the styling or the status menu, switching back to the nonstate,
                        and adding a transition, there are also fading hover effects that you can use where a image will
                        fade out and reveal another image or text/link and then the original image will fade back in
                        when not hovering over it anymore called image overlay fade. The true purpose of the image hover
                        effect is to make it have a range of purposes and a range of styles for the user to view by
                        either enlarging an image, adding color, or fading the color and bringing up any informative
                        text that overlays to the related image. The hover technique as well allows users to preview a
                        destination of a link before they click the link to see what the site is first.</p>

                    <p>When using hover effects, it is important to engage with the audience, for when the user might be
                        browsing your website and when the image hover effect triggers a movement or change that is
                        subtle to notice. This will automatically draw attention to the user with the image and the
                        connected text and can improve the user's engagement and interaction. Some advantages to using
                        image hover on a website are that it can the chance to increase sales for eCommerce sites, and
                        hover effects can provide different viewings for the product or show different products similar
                        to the original. It can enlarge the image or provide a zoom-in close-up go better to show off
                        the product to users who might seem interested so that they can avoid going to another page to
                        view the product on the product page instead. </p>
